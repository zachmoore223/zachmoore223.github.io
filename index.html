            Berserk:

        When I attack and survive damage, I make a bonus attack.

            Saga:

        When you first complete my saga, upgrade me and get a Treasure (may be completed multiples and get a treasure
        each time).

            Sea Treasures:
        </strong>
        When you triple a sea character, get a sea treasure instead of a normal treasure.
    </p>

    <p class="designNotes">
        When I had some extra time I designed a Storybook Brawl set. I designed it around some of my favorite things in
        Storybook Brawl, including casting a lot of spells,
        making slay a key theme, and having a lot of scaling for characters. The theme At Sea! seemed like an a fun
        focus for the set. I really liked the idea of having Vikings
        be the new "Dwarves" for the set and ships have sagas instead of quests. This makes keeping ships, even in your
        hand to complete sagas a interesting mechanism. I also
        really like the idea of adding sea treasure that were less powerful than normal treasure but easier to come by
        and naturally with pirates being the main evil characters,
        it was natural to have a treasure theme in the game as well.

        Though this will probably never see the light of day and I'll probably never get to playtest
        this version of the game, I had a ton of fun designing it and it was most certainly a passion project.
        I'm sure there a many errors and plenty of things that would be changed if it were playtested. Any ways, 
        I hope you enjoy looking over this expansion as much as I enjoyed creating it.

        Quick note, the characters show every character that would be included including ones from the previous game (some with slight flavor changes). The spells, treasures,
        and heroes would all remain the same from regular SBB except were noted.

    <!--CHARACTERS SECTION-->

    <h2> Characters</h2>
    <script>
        createCharactersTable();
    </script>
    <h3 class="designHeaders"> Character Notes</h3>
    <p class="designNotes">
        Too many to have design notes on, but some of my favorites are: Dread Pirate (upgrade would deal 2 damage obviously), Island Djinn, Seeress, Octo, Tinylight,
        Creature from the Black Lagoon, Davy Jones, Scurvy Dog (reverse good boy) and Jengu (my top pick).
    </p>

    <!--TREASURES SECTION-->

    <h2> Treasures</h2>
    <script>
        createTreasuresTable();
    </script>
    <h3 class="designHeaders"> Treasure Notes</h3>
    <p class="designNotes">
        Treasures cut: Corrupted Heart-wood, Dragon Nest, and Deepstone Mine.
        Locked Chest only gives you a regular treasure. Noble Steed changed to Saga characters instead of Quest (would probably change thematically to something ship related
        as well). Magic Runes changed works for regular and sea treasures. Treasure Map works for regular and sea treasures (I believe this is the only way to get the level 8
        sea treasure, which was my intention).  
        Pearl of Wisdom gives you a level 3 sea treasure to be clear. Ball of the Hags is probably my favorite treasure, basically a one shot crystal ball every turn. Buried Treasure
        should only be possible with treasure map and a level 6 sea creature upgrade.
    </p>


    <!--SPELLS SECTION-->

    <h2> Spells</h2>
    <script>
        createSpellsTable();
    </script>
    <h3 class="designHeaders"> Spell Notes</h3>
    <p class="designNotes">
        The spells Hi-Ho! and +7 health to treant spell is removed (I forget the name of it and wiki has old name I believe).
    </p>


    <!--HEROES SECTION-->

    <h2> Heroes</h2>
    <script>
        createHeroesTable();
    </script>
    <h3 class="designHeaders"> Hero Notes</h3>
    <p class="designNotes">
        Heroes would stay the same for the expansion with a few exceptions:
        Sir Galad might have to be changed to only working with regular treasures. Celestial Tiger is changed to only work with regular treasures. Horde Dragon only gives you
        one higher with regular treasures as well.
        <br/></br/>
        <strong>Achilles</strong> is a nice simple design. I think he would be an effective hero both early and late game. He would be especially fun to combo with Ring of Meteors treasure
        or Falling Stars spell. 
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Argus</strong> was one of the first ideas I had for an expansion. So far there has been no hand manipulation in Storybook Brawl. Probably one of my biggest
        gripes with the game is getting a spell in the shop and having to cast it since you cannot add it to your hand. I would want that to be changed as well, so you can drag a spell
        into your hand without casting it. I'm not sure if Argus would be really good but it seems like he would with him being able to keep more saga characters. 
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Blackbeard</strong> is one of those designs that I cannot tell without playtesting if he'd either be broken or terrible, but it's definitely one or the other. He might make it easier to force a strategy
        but not sure if that's good enough. Cthulthu would be a fun hero to play and of course I had to include him in a sea themed expansion. 
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Gilgamesh</strong> is another one o fmy favorites. I really like the idea of triggering last breath abilities more often.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Hook</strong> is probably way too powerful but he was a fun idea. I designed him thinking about what a good opposite to Peter Pants would look like.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Jack Ketch</strong> seems devious and I love it. I wanted something to counter act the amount of scaling in this expansion and this is a hero to help with
        that. With a pirate theme, I also wanted others to really fear going up against certain scenarios.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Long John Silver</strong> is a hero that I desperately wanted in the original Storybook Brawl but he's probably too powerful. If this were playtested
        and it was found too be too strong, it'd change to the extra slot only being able to hold a sea treasure. 
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Odin</strong> is another hero I felt was missing from the original SBB is someone that helped neutral characters. It may have been purposefully avoided, but
        with this expansion I felt it would be fun with a Vikings setup.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Poseidon</strong> is an obvious callback to Celestial Tiger. He might be too strong and need a health reduction. I would reduce health first instead of treasure
        levels since sea treasures are already less powerful than regular treasures and reducing them to just 2 and 3 would make him an worse Celestial Tiger.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Sedna</strong> is not a super interesting hero but a necessary design I felt for this version of SBB.
