        When you first complete my saga, upgrade me and get a Treasure (may be completed multiples and get a treasure

    <p class="designNotes">
        When I had some extra time I designed a Storybook Brawl set. I designed it around some of my favorite things in
        Storybook Brawl, including casting a lot of spells,
        making slay a key theme, and having a lot of scaling for characters. The theme At Sea! seemed like an a fun
        focus for the set. I really liked the idea of having Vikings
        be the new "Dwarves" for the set and ships have sagas instead of quests. This makes keeping ships, even in your
        hand to complete sagas a interesting mechanism. I also
        really like the idea of adding sea treasure that were less powerful than normal treasure but easier to come by
        and naturally with pirates being the main evil characters,
        it was natural to have a treasure theme in the game as well.

        Though this will probably never see the light of day and I'll probably never get to playtest
        this version of the game, I had a ton of fun designing it and it was most certainly a passion project.

        Hook is probably way too powerful but he was a fun idea. I basically wanted to try the opposite of Peter Pants.
